# Cursor Stats CSV Processor

A macOS app that processes Cursor analytics CSV files to filter and merge data for Swift extension usage.

## Features

- **Multiple File Support**: Drag and drop multiple CSV files at once or select multiple files
- **Swift Extension Filtering**: Automatically filters rows to only include entries where Swift is used as the "Most Used Apply Extension" or "Most Used Tab Extension"  
- **Smart Model Selection**: Determines the most-used model by analyzing total usage statistics across all days
- **Data Merging**: Combines multiple days of data for the same user (by email) by summing numeric columns
- **Column Removal**: Automatically removes "Is Active" and "Client Version" columns from the output
- **CSV Export**: Export the processed data to a new CSV file

## How to Use

1. **Generate Project**: Run `tuist generate` to create the Xcode workspace
2. **Launch the App**: Open `CursorStatsTool.xcworkspace` in Xcode or build and run the project
3. **Load CSV**: Drag and drop your CSV file(s) onto the app, or click the drop area to select multiple files
4. **Process Data**: Click the "Process Data" button to filter and merge the data
5. **Export**: Click "Export Processed CSV" to save the results to a new file

## Input Format

The app expects CSV files with the following columns (matching Cursor analytics export format):
- Date
- User ID
- Email
- Is Active
- Chat Suggested Lines Added
- Chat Suggested Lines Deleted
- Chat Accepted Lines Added
- Chat Accepted Lines Deleted
- Chat Total Applies
- Chat Total Accepts
- Chat Total Rejects
- Chat Tabs Shown
- Tabs Accepted
- Edit Requests
- Ask Requests
- Agent Requests
- Cmd+K Usages
- Subscription Included Reqs
- API Key Reqs
- Usage Based Reqs
- Bugbot Usages
- Most Used Model
- Most Used Apply Extension
- Most Used Tab Extension
- Client Version

## Output

The processed CSV will contain:
- All original columns except "Is Active" and "Client Version"
- Data merged by email address (summing numeric columns)
- Only rows where Swift is used as an extension
- "Date" column set to "Merged" for combined entries

## Requirements

- macOS 14.7 or later
- Xcode 16.0 or later (for building)
- Tuist 4.59.2 or later

## Building

1. Install Tuist: `brew install tuist` 
2. Generate the Xcode workspace: `tuist generate`
3. Open `CursorStatsTool.xcworkspace` in Xcode
4. Select your target device (Mac)
5. Build and run (âŒ˜+R)

## Project Structure

This project uses [Tuist](https://tuist.io) for project generation and management. The main configuration is in `Project.swift`. 

Key benefits:
- **Reproducible builds**: No more merge conflicts in `.xcodeproj` files
- **Modular architecture**: Easy to add new targets and dependencies
- **Generated files**: The `Derived/` folder contains auto-generated helper files
- **Version control friendly**: Only source files and `Project.swift` are tracked

## Example

If you have a CSV with multiple days of data for `john.doe@gotinder.com`:
- Day 1: 10 Chat Suggested Lines Added
- Day 2: 15 Chat Suggested Lines Added
- Day 3: 5 Chat Suggested Lines Added

The output will show one row for `john.doe@gotinder.com` with 30 Chat Suggested Lines Added (10+15+5).
